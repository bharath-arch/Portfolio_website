      <b>How to Calculate Financial Ratios?</b>
      <p> Most financial ratios can be calculated using numbers found on a company's financial statements, specifically the balance sheet and income statement. You can find these statements on the company's investor relations section of their website or financial websites.
        Each ratio has a specific formula, and a quick search online can provide the exact calculation for any ratio you're interested in. </p>
    
      <b>Decoding Financial Ratios: Understanding what they tell you</b>

      <p>Financial ratios are like little financial translators, taking complex financial information and condensing it into easy-to-understand metrics. Here's a breakdown of the ones you mentioned:</p>

      <ol type="I">
        <li>Profitability Ratios:</li>
            <p>Earnings per Share (EPS):** This ratio tells you how much profit a company makes per share of outstanding stock (Net Income / Shares Outstanding). A higher EPS indicates a more profitable company.</p>
            <p>Return on Equity Ratio (ROE):** This ratio measures how effectively a company uses shareholder equity to generate profits (Net Income / Shareholders' Equity). A higher ROE indicates better use of shareholder money.</p>
            <p>Profit Margin:** This ratio shows the portion of revenue remaining as profit after accounting for expenses (Net Income / Revenue). A higher profit margin indicates a company is efficient at generating profit from its sales.</p>
        <li>Valuation Ratios:</li>
            <p>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio):** This compares a company's stock price to its EPS (Share Price / EPS). It tells you how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings. A lower P/E ratio can suggest a company might be undervalued.</p>
            <p>Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio):** This compares a company's market value (Share Price x Outstanding Shares) to its book value (Total Assets - Total Liabilities). A lower P/B ratio might suggest a company is undervalued.</p>
        <li>Liquidity Ratios:</li>
            <p>Current Ratio:** This measures a company's ability to pay off short-term debts with its current assets (Current Assets / Current Liabilities). A higher current ratio indicates a stronger ability to meet short-term obligations.</p>
            <p>Quick Ratio:** This is a more stringent test of liquidity, excluding inventory from current assets as it may be harder to sell quickly (Current Assets - Inventory / Current Liabilities). A higher quick ratio indicates even stronger short-term financial health.</p>
        <li>Efficiency Ratio:</li>
            <p>PS Ratio (Price-to-Sales Ratio):** This compares a company's market value (Share Price x Outstanding Shares) to its revenue (Total Sales). A lower P/S ratio might suggest a company is undervalued relative to its sales.</p>
        <li>Debt & Coverage Ratios:</li>
            <p>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** This measures how much debt a company has compared to its shareholders' equity (Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity). A lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates a more financially conservative company.</p>
            <p>Interest Coverage Ratio:** This measures a company's ability to cover its interest expenses with its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT / Interest Expense). A higher interest coverage ratio indicates a stronger ability to meet debt obligations.</p>
        <li>Other Ratios:</li>
            <p>Dividend Yield:** This shows the percentage return on a company's stock from dividends paid per share in a year (Annual Dividend per Share / Share Price). A higher dividend yield indicates a larger portion of profits returned to shareholders.</p>
            <p>Savings Ratio:** This is typically used in personal finance, not company analysis. It measures the portion of income saved after expenses (Savings / Disposable Income).</p>
